# Predicting a hit Song

Using Machine Learning Models to predict a song's popularity.

This is a [group](#team) project from the Data Science and Advanced Analytics course from the Big Data &amp; Analytics Masters @ [EAE](https://www.eae.es/) class of 2021.

## This was our first rough idea

## After playing with some tools and online services

## Our final work followed this process / artifacts

## Linked Repos to the three components
* Preparing additional / artists' data to feed into the model

* Analyzing and understanding the data at scale
https://github.com/joseph-higaki/music-hit-analyze-data
* Training the models
